## Getting Started

- This app is functional micro post blog with the possibility to create,read and
  delete posts (Admin only has access to delete). To access full functionality,
  the user should log in, if an account exists, or create one as a new user
  through email authentication process. The app is connected to the database
  accordingly, Amazon bucket used as external storage.

  - This application includes examples of all the major features of Rails, including models, views, controllers, templates, partials, filters, validations, callbacks, has_many/belongs_to and has_many :through associations, security, testing, and deployment.
